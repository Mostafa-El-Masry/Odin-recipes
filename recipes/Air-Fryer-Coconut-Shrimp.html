        <li>Step 1:
            Stir together flour and pepper in a shallow dish. Lightly beat eggs in a second shallow dish.
            Stir together coconut and panko in a third shallow dish.</li>
        <li>Step 2:
            Working one at a time, dredge shrimp in flour mixture; shake off excess. Dip floured shrimp in egg;
            allow any excess to drip off. Finally, dredge in coconut mixture, pressing to adhere.
            Place shrimp on a plate. Coat shrimp well with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Step 3:
            Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place 1/2 of the shrimp in the air fryer
            and cook about 3 minutes. Turn shrimp over and continue cooking until golden,
            about 3 minutes more. Season with 1/4 teaspoon salt. Repeat with remaining shrimp.</li>
        <li>Step 4:
            Meanwhile, whisk together honey, lime juice, and serrano chile in a small bowl.</li>
