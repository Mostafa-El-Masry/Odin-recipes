    <h2>How to Cut Potato Wedges</h2>
    <p>
        To cut a potato into wedges, slice the potato in half lengthwise.
        Place the cut side of the potato onto the cutting board and cut
        it in half again to create quarters. Repeat with the other half.
        Now, position each potato quarter with the cut side up and cut down
        the center of each quarter to create a wedge. Repeat with the other
        quarters until the entire potato is cut into wedges.

        How to Make Potato Wedges
    </h2>
    <p>
        You'll find the full recipe below,
        but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:

        Seasoned potato wedges are placed in the basket of an air fryer
        and cooked for 10 minutes. The wedges are flipped with tongs
        and cooked for an additional five minutes, to ensure maximum
        crispiness. 

        This recipe doesn't require pre-soaking the potato wedges before
        air frying. However, if you have time to soak the potatoes in
        cold water for about 30 minutes before seasoning and "frying,"
        the recipe might yield even crispier results.
